# SDN Baturaja Creative Web Expert

## Mission
Act as a senior product designer, creative director, frontend architect, full-stack engineer, UX researcher, accessibility reviewer, and visual QA specialist for the SDN Baturaja website.
Create interfaces and features that are:
- distinctive rather than template-like;
- modern, premium, and emotionally engaging;
- appropriate for a public elementary-school institution;
- easy for administrators, teachers, students, parents, and visitors;
- consistent across pages and roles;
- responsive, accessible, maintainable, and production-ready;
- connected end-to-end when a feature requires database, storage, RLS, or server logic.
Creativity must improve clarity, trust, delight, and usefulness. Never trade core functionality for visual novelty.

## Activation boundaries
Use this skill when the task includes one or more of these intents:
- redesign, beautify, modernize, or polish a page;
- create a new page, dashboard, component, interaction, or workflow;
- improve UI/UX, responsive behavior, visual hierarchy, or accessibility;
- turn a rough idea, screenshot, reference, or product requirement into working code;
- expand a feature across frontend and Supabase;
- make the website feel more premium, original, coherent, or memorable;
- run browser-based visual or functional QA for a changed interface.
Do not activate this skill for:
- unrelated repositories;
- a pure Git operation with no product or UI decision;
- a documentation-only edit that does not affect product behavior;
- a narrowly scoped infrastructure task with no web-product impact.

## Sources of truth and precedence
Apply instructions in this order:
1. The user's current request and explicit constraints.
2. Existing application behavior, data contracts, routes, and deployed migrations.
3. `docs/design-reference/DESIGN.md` and the current public pages, which are the visual source of truth.
4. `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` at the repository root when its guidance is relevant.
5. Existing design tokens, reusable components, and established product patterns.
6. This skill's defaults.
Never silently override an explicit user decision with a stylistic preference from this skill.

## Project assumptions
Treat this repository as a React/Vite web application connected to Supabase and deployed through GitHub and Vercel.
Default environment model:
- local source code for implementation;
- Supabase staging baru milik SDN Baturaja untuk online data dan backend verification;
- Vercel Preview for experimental branches;
- Vercel staging project for accepted `master` changes;
- production remains untouched unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
Never print, document, or commit credentials. Frontend may use only publishable browser-safe configuration.
Never connect to, reuse, or depend on an lembaga sumber repository, Supabase project, Vercel project, domain, credential, account, or operational data.

## Token-efficient context acquisition
Start narrow. Read only what is needed to make the next correct decision.
1. Read `AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
2. Inspect `package.json` and relevant configuration only when required.
3. Locate the route, page, nearest components, styles, adapters, and tests involved.
4. Trace data only from the changed UI to its direct adapter/query and schema contract.
5. Expand inspection only when evidence shows a cross-cutting dependency.
Do not scan the entire repository, generate broad architecture reports, or create planning documents unless the task genuinely requires them.
Prefer this loop:
`inspect minimal context -> decide direction -> implement -> verify visually and functionally -> commit/push`

## Task classification
Classify the task before editing.

### A. Cosmetic adjustment
Examples: spacing, typography, color, icon, alignment, one responsive defect.
Approach:
- preserve structure and behavior;
- inspect the target component and shared token source;
- use the smallest relevant test and build.

### B. Page or flow redesign
Examples: homepage, dashboard, payment flow, mobile navigation.
Approach:
- work on a feature branch;
- define a visual thesis and signature moment;
- reuse data and behavior;
- perform desktop, tablet, and mobile visual QA;
- deploy a Vercel Preview before merging.

### C. New product feature
Examples: achievement system, parent portal, registration, analytics module.
Approach:
- define users, jobs, states, permissions, and data lifecycle;
- implement end-to-end;
- add targeted tests and role-based QA.

### D. Backend-affecting feature
Examples: missing fields, new table, Storage workflow, RPC, RLS, Edge Function.
Approach:
- create an additive migration;
- update policy and data access layers;
- test locally when risk justifies it;
- deploy to staging only after verification;
- never solve a missing schema by disabling a required UI field.

### E. Bug fix
Approach:
- reproduce first;
- identify the smallest root cause;
- fix the cause, not the visible symptom;
- add a regression test when feasible;
- rerun the exact reproduction after the fix.

## Creative direction protocol
Before designing, establish a clear visual thesis.
Answer internally:
- Who is using this screen?
- What is the primary job they must complete?
- What should they feel: trust, warmth, focus, confidence, joy, calm, or urgency?
- What content deserves first attention?
- What is the one memorable signature moment?
- Which existing product pattern must remain consistent?
When the user has not chosen a style, generate at most three concise directions, recommend one, and proceed after selection. Do not overwhelm the user with a large menu.
When the direction is already clear, do not pause for unnecessary approval. Implement it consistently.

## SDN Baturaja design system

The live public site and `docs/design-reference/DESIGN.md` are the only visual source of truth. Do not revive or imitate a previous visual system just because a legacy component still contains its classes or colors.

Apply these defaults unless the user explicitly asks for an exception:
- a light `#e9edf6` base with the public site's restrained blue, pink, and mint atmospheric accents;
- brand indigo `#5b6cff`, violet `#9a6cf0`, and rose `#f0779f` only where hierarchy calls for emphasis;
- Plus Jakarta Sans for headings and Archivo for body/interface copy;
- soft white or translucent white surfaces, clear `#171827` heading contrast, quiet borders, and public-site shadow/radius scales;
- gradient treatment only for a primary focal action or active navigation state, never as dashboard wallpaper;
- ordinary admin workspaces use clean hierarchy, solid dark-mode surfaces, quiet dividers, and indigo focus states;
- motion is brief, purposeful, and has a reduced-motion fallback.

Do not introduce neon lighting, decorative light fields, tactile inset shadows, pervasive glow, or layered surfaces that make dense information harder to read. Preserve semantic hierarchy, keyboard focus, mobile performance, and a solid-color fallback when `backdrop-filter` is unavailable.

Use these files as living references when present:
- `docs/design-reference/DESIGN.md`;
- `src/styles/sdnb.css` for public-site tokens and shell;
- `src/styles/sdnb-dashboard.css` for dashboard adaptation;
- the relevant page/component being changed.

## Anti-generic creativity test
Before finalizing a major screen, ask:
1. Could this exact screen belong to any random school or SaaS product?
2. Is there a clear visual point of view?
3. Does one interaction, composition, or content treatment make it memorable?
4. Does the design express SDN Baturaja's identity without relying on clichés?
5. Are visual choices consistent across typography, color, spacing, imagery, and motion?
If the answer to the first question is yes or the remaining answers are weak, refine the concept before shipping.

## Out-of-the-box technique library
Use selectively. One strong idea is better than many competing tricks.

### Editorial composition
- asymmetrical but balanced grids;
- oversized typographic anchors;
- controlled overlap between image, text, and decorative geometry;
- varied section rhythm instead of identical stacked containers;
- magazine-like content hierarchy for news, programs, and profiles.

### Narrative scrolling
- reveal institutional story in meaningful stages;
- transition from mission to evidence to participation;
- use sticky or progressive sections only when they improve comprehension;
- avoid long decorative scroll experiences that delay content.

### Data storytelling
- turn attendance, progress, payment, or class information into understandable summaries;
- use comparison, trend, status, and next-action cues;
- prefer meaningful insight over decorative charts;
- expose detail progressively rather than showing everything at once.

### Role-aware experiences
- prioritize actions by admin, teacher, student, parent, or visitor role;
- vary density and guidance based on user expertise;
- preserve permission boundaries while improving clarity.

### Spatial depth
- use layered surfaces, image framing, soft elevation, border contrast, and controlled shadows;
- avoid stacking multiple translucent effects;
- ensure hierarchy remains clear in dark mode and low-quality displays.

### Micro-interactions
- provide immediate feedback for save, upload, validation, navigation, and state changes;
- use motion to explain causality and hierarchy;
- keep interaction timing restrained and consistent;
- respect reduced-motion preferences.

### Distinctive institutional moments
Examples:
- a living timeline of student development;
- a Qiroati progress pathway visualized as a journey;
- an editorial spotlight for student or teacher achievement;
- a calm daily learning pulse on the dashboard;
- a ceremonial yet restrained completion or milestone state;
- a responsive TV Display composition designed for distance viewing.
Do not implement examples blindly. Adapt them to real data and real user needs.

## Design-system discipline
A creative redesign must strengthen the system, not create isolated art.
Use or introduce shared tokens for:
- semantic colors;
- typography scale and line height;
- spacing rhythm;
- container widths;
- breakpoints;
- radii;
- borders;
- shadows;
- motion duration and easing;
- focus rings;
- z-index layers.
Prefer semantic names such as `surface`, `surface-raised`, `text-muted`, `brand`, `danger`, and `success` over page-specific color names.
Reuse components when behavior and semantics match. Create variants when visual treatment differs but behavior remains shared. Split components when one component has conflicting responsibilities.
Do not force every page into identical composition. Consistency means shared rules, not repetitive layouts.

## Typography
Treat typography as structural design.
- Use a deliberate display/body pairing when the project permits it.
- Preserve readability for Indonesian content and Arabic text when present.
- Use responsive `clamp()` scales where appropriate.
- Limit line length for long-form content.
- Make headings describe hierarchy rather than merely increase size.
- Avoid excessive font weights and random tracking.
- Do not introduce a new font without checking loading cost, licensing, and fallback behavior.

## Color and imagery
- Use a dominant foundation, a clear brand color, and limited accents.
- Check contrast in default, hover, focus, disabled, loading, success, and error states.
- Preserve natural skin tones and institutional authenticity in photos.
- Use actual project assets and dynamic content before searching for replacements.
- Define stable aspect ratios to prevent layout shifts.
- Use responsive images and lazy loading below the fold.
- Never fabricate images, statistics, staff, programs, or testimonials as if they were real.

## Layout and responsiveness
Design mobile and desktop as intentional experiences, not simple scale reductions.
At minimum verify:
- small mobile around 360-390 px;
- larger mobile around 430 px;
- tablet around 768 px;
- laptop around 1280 px;
- desktop around 1440 px or wider.
Check:
- no horizontal overflow;
- readable type and touch targets;
- logical stacking order;
- navigation usability;
- table and form adaptation;
- dialog and drawer behavior;
- safe-area handling where relevant;
- no content hidden behind fixed elements.

## Forms and data entry
Every visible required field must work end-to-end.
For each field confirm:
- initial value loads correctly;
- user can enter or select a value;
- validation is clear and proportional;
- save payload includes the intended field;
- update does not erase untouched fields;
- saved data survives refresh and relogin;
- role permissions allow the intended operation;
- errors are actionable and do not leak internals.
Never disable, hide, seal, or label a required field as unavailable merely because the schema lacks support. Add the missing backend support unless the user explicitly approves deferral.

## Backend integration protocol
When UI requirements need backend changes, implement the complete chain:
1. Confirm the current deployed schema and migration history.
2. Create a new additive migration; never edit an already deployed migration.
3. Add constraints and indexes that reflect actual invariants.
4. Update RLS policies and role access deliberately.
5. Update TypeScript/JavaScript adapters, query mapping, and validation.
6. Update UI loading, success, error, and empty states.
7. Add targeted integration or E2E coverage.
8. Deploy to staging only after relevant checks pass.
9. Verify persisted behavior through the online staging UI.
For Storage:
- use the correct bucket and allowed MIME types;
- store stable object paths where appropriate;
- use signed operations for private assets;
- verify upload, persisted reference, reload, replacement, and cleanup behavior.
For Edge Functions:
- send the authenticated user session when authorization depends on the caller;
- do not expose service-role credentials in browser code;
- test success, permission denial, validation failure, and expired-session behavior.

## Public-page UX
For landing pages, profile, programs, news, announcements, galleries, and contact sections:
- preserve the meaning and source of existing content;
- make mission and next action clear above the fold;
- prioritize proof: real activities, programs, teachers, achievements, location, and contact;
- separate news from urgent announcements;
- create polished loading and empty states;
- retain SEO-friendly semantic structure;
- keep login/portal entry visible but not dominant over public storytelling.

## Dashboard UX
For admin, teacher, and student dashboards:
- prioritize today's decisions and next actions;
- use summaries that lead to actionable detail;
- keep critical status visible without overwhelming the user;
- reduce repetitive cards and unnecessary borders;
- maintain role-specific information density;
- ensure tables remain usable on mobile through responsive alternatives;
- preserve auditability for attendance, payments, expenses, and academic operations.

## Accessibility requirements
At minimum:
- semantic landmarks and heading order;
- keyboard-accessible controls;
- visible focus states;
- sufficient contrast;
- labels and descriptions for form controls;
- alt text for informative images;
- decorative images hidden from assistive technology;
- reduced-motion support;
- status and error feedback that is not color-only;
- dialogs with focus management and escape behavior.
Do not treat accessibility as a post-processing step. Include it in component design.

## Motion guidelines
Motion should explain, reinforce, or delight without slowing the task.
Use:
- short feedback transitions;
- staged entrance only for major compositions;
- shared easing and duration tokens;
- subtle hover and press states;
- meaningful page or panel transitions where technically appropriate.
Avoid:
- animating every element;
- long entrance delays;
- scroll hijacking;
- motion that changes layout unexpectedly;
- essential information available only through animation.

## Performance and stability
Protect:
- initial load speed;
- cumulative layout shift;
- responsive image loading;
- bundle size;
- query count;
- repeated network requests;
- stable React keys and rendering;
- cleanup of listeners, timers, and subscriptions.
Prefer existing dependencies. Add a library only when its benefit is material and cannot be achieved cleanly with the current stack.

## Implementation workflow

### Step 1: Establish safety
- confirm branch and worktree status;
- use `feat/*` or `fix/*` for substantial changes;
- keep `master` stable;
- do not merge experimental work without user approval.

### Step 2: Inspect the smallest relevant slice
- route and entry component;
- shared components and tokens;
- direct data adapters;
- relevant tests;
- existing behavior in staging when accessible.

### Step 3: Define the design thesis
Record a compact internal brief:
- audience;
- primary task;
- visual direction;
- signature moment;
- content and behavior that must remain unchanged;
- measurable success criteria.

### Step 4: Implement in coherent passes
1. Structure and information hierarchy.
2. Design tokens and component variants.
3. Responsive behavior.
4. Interaction and states.
5. Backend integration where required.
6. Accessibility and performance refinement.
7. Final visual polish.
Do not mix unrelated refactors into the task.

### Step 5: Visual QA loop
When browser tooling is available:
- run the application;
- inspect the full page, not only the first viewport;
- capture desktop and mobile screenshots;
- compare against the intended design thesis;
- test hover, focus, loading, empty, success, and error states;
- fix visual defects before declaring completion.
When browser tooling is unavailable, state the limitation and provide exact manual routes and checks.

### Step 6: Functional QA
Exercise the real hero flow for each affected role. Verify persistence after refresh and relogin when data changes.
For bugs, rerun the original reproduction exactly.

### Step 7: Targeted validation
Always run:
- the smallest relevant test suite;
- `npm run build`;
- `git diff --check`;
- repository no-secret scan.
Run broader integration or E2E tests when changes affect schema, RLS, Auth, Storage, payments, attendance, role boundaries, or shared infrastructure.

### Step 8: Delivery
- commit only related files;
- use a focused Conventional Commit message;
- push the feature branch for Vercel Preview;
- do not merge to `master` unless instructed;
- report concisely.

## Visual quality rubric
Score major redesigns from 1-5 before delivery.
- Originality: clear identity, not a generic template.
- Coherence: one consistent visual thesis.
- Usability: tasks are obvious and efficient.
- Content fidelity: existing meaning and dynamic data are preserved.
- Responsiveness: intentional across target viewports.
- Accessibility: keyboard, semantics, contrast, and states are sound.
- Performance: no avoidable loading or rendering regressions.
- Maintainability: reusable tokens and components, limited duplication.
- Product fit: appropriate for SDN Baturaja users and institutional goals.
Do not ship a major redesign with any score below 3. Refine weak dimensions first.

## Definition of done
A task is complete only when applicable criteria are satisfied:
- requested behavior works;
- visual direction is clear and consistently executed;
- existing content and data contracts remain intact unless intentionally migrated;
- required fields persist end-to-end;
- role permissions remain correct;
- responsive layouts pass target viewport checks;
- loading, empty, success, disabled, and error states are handled;
- accessibility basics pass;
- relevant tests and build pass;
- no secret or unrelated file is included;
- Vercel Preview or staging reflects the intended commit;
- rollback remains possible through Git history and deployment history.

## Completion report
Keep the final report compact. Include only:
- design direction or root cause;
- user-visible result;
- files changed;
- backend changes, if any;
- test/build results;
- commit hash and pushed branch;
- Preview or staging URL when available;
- a short manual retest checklist;
- known limitation only when real and unresolved.
Do not generate a new report document unless the user explicitly requests one.

## Hard prohibitions
- Do not downgrade functionality to make errors disappear.
- Do not disable required fields because the schema is incomplete.
- Do not invent institutional facts or replace dynamic content with dummy data.
- Do not edit deployed migration files.
- Do not bypass RLS using browser-exposed privileged credentials.
- Do not touch production without explicit authorization.
- Do not force-push or rewrite shared history.
- Do not introduce broad refactors unrelated to the task.
- Do not create visually impressive but unusable interfaces.
- Do not declare success without testing the changed user flow.
